NEON CREDENTIAL CONFIGURATION FOR N8N
============================================================

Copy these values into n8n UI:

Credential Name: Neon PostgreSQL - Ralph
Host:            ep-purple-hall-ahimeyn0-pooler.c-3.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech
Port:            5432
Database:        neondb
User:            neondb_owner
Password:        npg_c3UNa4KOlCeL
SSL:             ON (Toggle Enabled)

============================================================
QUICK STEPS FOR RIVET-009:
============================================================

1. Open n8n at: http://72.60.175.144:5678

2. Navigate to: Workflows

3. Open: "Ralph Main Loop" workflow

4. Click ANY purple Postgres node (there are 7 total)

5. In the right panel, find "Credential" dropdown

6. Click: "+ Create New Credential"

7. Fill in the form with values above:
   - Name:     Neon PostgreSQL - Ralph
   - Host:     ep-purple-hall-ahimeyn0-pooler.c-3.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech
   - Port:     5432
   - Database: neondb
   - User:     neondb_owner
   - Password: npg_c3UNa4KOlCeL
   - SSL:      Toggle ON (enable)

8. Click: "Create"

9. You should see a green checkmark on the node!

10. Check the other 6 Postgres nodes - they should ALL automatically
    have the credential selected (green checkmark)

11. Click "Save" (top right of workflow)

12. Click "Execute Workflow" to test

13. Check execution log - no database errors = SUCCESS!

============================================================
WHY THIS WORKS:
============================================================

The Ralph Main Loop workflow JSON already has credential references
for all 7 Postgres nodes:

  - Create Execution (node 1)
  - Get Next Story (node 2)
  - Mark Story In Progress (node 3)
  - Record Story Result (node 4)
  - Update Story Status (node 5)
  - Mark Execution Complete (node 6)
  - Handle Error (node 7)

All 7 reference: id: "neon-ralph", name: "Neon - RALPH"

Once you create the credential with name "Neon PostgreSQL - Ralph",
n8n will automatically link it to all 7 nodes. You don't need to
manually wire each one!

============================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING:
============================================================

If you see "connection timeout" or "authentication failed":

1. Double-check the host is exactly:
   ep-purple-hall-ahimeyn0-pooler.c-3.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech

2. Make sure SSL is toggled ON

3. Verify the password has no extra spaces

4. Check your VPS can reach neon.tech:
   ping ep-purple-hall-ahimeyn0-pooler.c-3.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech

If workflow shows red error boxes:

1. The credential wasn't saved correctly
2. Try deleting and recreating it
3. Make sure you clicked "Create" (not just filled the form)

If nodes still show no credential:

1. The credential name might not match exactly
2. Name must be: "Neon PostgreSQL - Ralph" (case-sensitive)
3. Or just select it manually from dropdown on each node

============================================================
VERIFICATION:
============================================================

After creating the credential, verify it works:

1. Click "Execute Workflow" button (top right)
2. Watch the nodes execute (they'll light up green)
3. Check the execution log (bottom panel)
4. Look for database query results
5. No red errors = SUCCESS!

Expected result:
- First node (Create Execution) should insert a row
- Second node (Get Next Story) should return a story or empty result
- All nodes complete without database connection errors

============================================================

DONE? Mark RIVET-009 as complete and move on to final deployment!
